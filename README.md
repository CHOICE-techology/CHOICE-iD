# CHOICE iD — Combined Tech Stack & Popular Backend-Light Proposal

This document merges the overall architectural feedback with a refined, popular tech stack proposal. 
It focuses on delivering a robust, privacy-first solution while avoiding unnecessary backend complexity, recommending widely adopted frameworks to simplify delivery and
maintenance.

## 1. Overall Impression

The architecture is future-ready, privacy-first, and modular. It effectively balances self-sovereign identity principles, zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), and federated AI to deliver a secure, scalable identity and reputation system. 
The modularity supports cross-chain adoption and long-term maintainability.

## 2. Keeping the Backend Simple

Decentralized storage (IPFS/Filecoin) for non-sensitive metadata.
- Client-side biometric and AI processing.
- On-chain verification for credentials and reputation scores.
- Lightweight GraphQL or REST API for UI integration, avoiding heavy server logic.
- Modular microservices that can scale independently when needed.

## 3. Security, Compliance & Future-proofing

- Post-Quantum Cryptography readiness.
- Regular independent cryptographic audits.
- Early integration of bug bounty programs post-testnet.
- Multi-chain interoperability for resilience and adoption. 

## 4. Popular, Backend-Light Tech Stack Proposal

Goal: adopt widely used, well supported tools to simplify delivery and keep the backend minimal,
while preserving CHOICE iD’s core principles.

  - Guardrails & Scope
    - Preserve SSI and Verifiable Credentials; anchor proofs on-chain; keep raw PII and biometrics off-device-local.
    - Favor managed services and SDKs with large communities and mature documentation.
    - Defer advanced ZKML and federated learning to later phases; begin with transparent, explainable scoring

  - Recommended Stack
    - Frontend: Next.js (React) + TypeScript; Tailwind or Chakra UI; TanStack Query for state/data management.
    - Wallet & Web3: wagmi + viem + RainbowKit; Sign-In With Ethereum (SIWE) for authentication.
    - Biometrics: WebAuthn/Passkeys for device biometrics; no biometric data leaves device.
    - Mobile: React Native + Expo; optional TensorFlow Lite for on-device ML.
    - Smart Contracts: Developed in Solidity using OpenZeppelin standards for security and maintainability. Deploy primarily on Arbitrum One (Layer 2) with optional Base
      deployment for extra reach. Use Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) to record verifiable claims/endorsements, following W3C Verifiable Credential formats. Store only credential hashes on-chain for cost efficiency and privacy.
    - Storage: IPFS via web3.storage; S3 fallback with content hashes.
    - Backend: BFF with Next.js API routes (or NestJS); PostgreSQL (Supabase/Neon/Aurora); The Graph or Envio for indexing; Redis for caching
    - Reputation: Start with rule-based scoring; publish Merkle root on-chain; add Explainable AI later
    - Marketplace: OIDC + SIWE + W3C VC/DID; milestone-based escrow; simple explainable matching

  - Why This Is Simpler
    - Popular libraries minimize custom code and hiring risk.
    - WebAuthn removes the need for bespoke biometric pipelines.
    - EAS attestations are widely adopted and easy to verify.
    - Managed databases and BFF pattern reduce operational complexity

  - Incremental Roadmap
    - MVP: SIWE + WebAuthn; EAS attestations; Solidity smart contracts on Arbitrum; IPFS pointers;
    - minimal REST APIs; rule-based reputation.
    - Beta: zk-KYC via PolygonID/Spruce, explainable scoring, subgraph indexing, employer dashboard.
    - Advanced: Federated learning; zk-proofs for score integrity optional AR/XR R&D.
  
  - Risks & Mitigations
    - Vendor SDK lock-in — pick open-source friendly options and keep abstractions thin.
    - Reputation gaming — apply rate limits, issuer weighting, challenge-response verification.
    - Compliance drift — consented data flows, regular audits, no biometric templates on servers.

  - 4.6 Minimal Backend Responsibilities

    - Credential/attestation resolver and read API (no PII storage).
    - Score aggregator writing Merkle roots on-chain.
    - Indexing cache plus webhook handlers.
    - Public documentation and SDKs for integrators


## Conclusion

  By combining high-level architectural principles with a pragmatic, popular framework selection, CHOICE iD can maintain its privacy-first vision while ensuring faster delivery, lower complexity, and easier long-term maintenance. 
  The smart contract layer will follow Solidity best practices and OpenZeppelin standards while leveraging Arbitrum and EAS for efficient, verifiable, privacy-preserving credential management.
